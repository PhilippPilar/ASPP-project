Ever since I first heard of the game of life I wanted to implement it someday. Finally that day has come!

Description:

An implementation of the game of life can be found in the files gameoflife.py and patterns.py in the folder GameOfLife. Various patterns and shapes of the grid are possible. It is possible to output the evolution of the system either immediately during the evolution or afterwards as a .gif.

Documentation has been created with Sphinx and can be found in the docs folder.

The test function test_gol.py has been created to ensure consistent evolution of the game of life.

The file setup.py has been created to allow for packaging of the code via pip. 

A .travis.yml has been added to include CI via Travis (see https://travis-ci.org/github/PhilippPilar/ASPP-project/builds).
